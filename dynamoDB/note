Capacity Units
    RCU (Read Capacity Unit)    - 1RCU 4kb/sec
    WCU (Write Capacity Unit)   - 1WCU 1kb/sec

Partitions
    Partitions manged internally by DynamoDB.
    A table can have multiple partitions.
    Number of table partitions depend on its size and provisioned capacity.
    1 partition = 10GB of data.
    1 partition = 1000 WCUs or 3000 RCUs

    Example:
        provisioned capacity: 500 RCUs and 500 WCUs
        P = 500/3000 + 500/1000;
        p = 0.67 ~ 1 partition

        provisioned capacity: 1000 RCUs and 1000 WCUs
        P = 1000/3000 + 1000/1000;
        p = 1.33 ~ 2 partitions

Indexes
    Mandatory Primary Key - either simple or composite.
    Simple Primary Key - only partition or hash key.
    Composite Primary Key - Partition Key + Sort or Range key.

Local Secondary Indexes
    You can create 5 local secondary indexes.
    Use same partition key but diferent sort key.
    Must be created when you create your table.
    
Global Secondary Index
    You can create 5 global secondary indexes.
    Use diferent partition and sort keys.
    Can be created any time.
    Not suported strongly consistent read, only eventualy.
    Can set RCUs and WCUs separatly from capacity uits of the base table.
